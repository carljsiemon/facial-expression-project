# Facial Expression Classification Web App | :smile: :frowning: :open_mouth:
Chris Green, March 2015

##TL;DR
This Django project classifies a person's face as either happy, sad, or surprised. The live web-app can be found [here][1]. The convolutional neural network training code and documentation can be found in [this repo][2].

##Overview
Can we teach a machine to recognize human emotions? That was the question I wanted to tackle in my capstone project for [Zipfian Academy's][4] winter 2015 data science cohort.

##Model
A detailed overview of the facial expression classification package used in this app can be found [here][1].
